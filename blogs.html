                        There are many differences between var and let in JavaScript Although var and let do the same
                        thing in some cases, there
                        are many differences between them and in other cases they represent them differently.A constant
                        is an immutable
                        JavaScript variable that can never be changed.
                        The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in
                        JavaScript include:
                        Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
                        Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be
                        accessed in their enclosing
                        scope even before they are declared.
                        Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have
                        scope to the immediate
                        enclosing block.
                        And Const Will Be Not Changable ,

                        regular function in JavaScript because they help to
                        express the same value in the same way but their writing or presentation is different which is
                        that regular function
                        presents more elaborate functionality that function handles the work and on the other hand its
                        function has less number
                        of writing. Can manage the activities of various organizations through.And there is a syntax
                        difference between these two functions.Normal function exposes a lot of syntax while its
                        function
                        exposes a small and less syntax to perform functionality operations.

                        allowing for multi-line strings, for string
                        interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called tagged templates.

                        Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most
                        commonly for string
                        interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged
                        template literal may not
                        result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you
                        want on the different
                        parts of the template literal.
